 # WebVuln: Scan Screen

## Overview
The `scanScreen` is a Flutter widget that allows users to scan a URL for vulnerabilities. It features a text input field where users can enter the URL they want to scan, a list of modules that can be used to scan the URL, and a button to initiate the scan.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. These include:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';
import 'package:webvuln/items/newSubmitButton.dart';
import 'package:external_path/external_path.dart';
import 'package:webvuln/service/api.dart';
import 'package:webvuln/views/loadingScreen.dart';
import 'package:webvuln/views/variable.dart';
import '../items/input.dart';
```

### 2. Defining the `scanScreen` Widget
The `scanScreen` widget is defined as a `StatefulWidget`. This means that it can change its state over time. The state of the widget is managed by the `_scanScreenState` class.

### 3. Initializing the State
In the `initState` method of the `_scanScreenState` class, the initial state of the widget is set. This includes setting the `_numberModule` variable to 0 and the `_isVisibled` variable to `false`.

### 4. Building the Widget
The `build` method of the `_scanScreenState` class is responsible for building the widget. It returns a `Column` widget that contains the following child widgets:

- A `SizedBox` widget that adds some vertical space.
- A `Container` widget that contains the "WEBVULN" logo.
- A `Container` widget that contains the text input field for the URL.
- A `Container` widget that contains the list of modules that can be used to scan the URL.
- A `SizedBox` widget that adds some vertical space.
- A `GradientButton` widget that initiates the scan.

### 5. Handling the Scan Button Click
When the user clicks the scan button, the `onPressed` handler of the `GradientButton` widget
